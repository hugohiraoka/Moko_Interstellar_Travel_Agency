7,32,101,7,2019-02-15,5,"As soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up. Gregor's mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into his chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: ""What a life! This is what peace I get in my old age!"" And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him."
8,32,10,8,2019-02-17,4,"Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor's room and say ""Close that door, Grete"", and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table."
9,63,1,9,2019-02-12,5,"Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would think of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor's sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or - more often than not - had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up Gregor's room was for her and her alone. Gregor's mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise."
10,13,149,10,2019-02-15,4,"No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient."
11,13,198,11,2019-01-24,5,"With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful."
12,31,55,12,2019-02-15,3,"Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen - all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their way into Gregor's room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards."
13,26,29,13,2019-02-20,5,"The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor's mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled."
14,65,5,14,2019-01-28,3,"The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor's father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. ""I'd like to eat something"", said Gregor anxiously, ""but not anything like they're eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!"""
15,17,202,15,2019-02-08,5,"Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: ""Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away."" ""On the contrary"", said the middle gentleman, ""would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?"" ""Oh yes, we'd love to"", called back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin player himself. The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out of the way in a corner."
16,70,98,16,2019-02-20,4,"His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What's more, there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room."
17,9,103,17,2019-02-10,4,"No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor's father observed them anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet Gregor's sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came. Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already? - if this misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar."
18,62,66,18,2019-02-22,3,"""Mr. Samsa!"", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it. They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor's sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward. Under his sister's experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room. Gregor's father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor's father to a halt. ""I declare here and now"", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother and sister to gain their attention too, ""that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family"" - here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - ""I give immediate notice on my room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action."" He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: ""And we also give immediate notice."" With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door."
19,60,21,19,2019-02-05,5,"Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor."
20,5,147,20,2019-02-14,4,"""Father, Mother"", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, ""we can't carry on like this. Maybe you can't see it, but I can. I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it. We've done all that's humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong."""
21,68,193,21,2019-02-19,5,"""She's absolutely right"", said Gregor's father to himself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes."
22,16,47,22,2019-02-19,5,"Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile."
23,45,65,23,2019-02-22,4,"After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad - until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. They became quieter. Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body."
24,69,62,24,2019-02-09,3,"""Tonight she gets sacked"", said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while. Then he called out: ""Come here, then. Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of attention"". The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters."
25,59,97,25,2019-02-15,4,"They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her contractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished her work for that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. ""Well?"", asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. ""What is it you want then?"", asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for. ""Yes"", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, ""well then, that thing in there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it. That's all been sorted out."" Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out ""Cheerio then, everyone"", turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went."
26,24,20,26,2019-02-05,5,Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face against her father's arm.
27,40,122,27,2019-02-17,5,"""Leave my home. Now!"", said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without letting the women from him. ""What do you mean?"", asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour. ""I mean just what I said"", answered Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions. ""Alright, we'll go then"", he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat."
28,37,124,28,2019-02-22,4,"The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. ""Where is our breakfast?"", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's room. They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room."
29,43,168,29,2019-03-02,5,"""Grete, come with us in here for a little while"", said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all."
30,38,154,30,2019-02-11,4,"Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went into Gregor's room. On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. ""Dead?"", asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking. ""That's what I said"", replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. ""Now then"", said Mr. Samsa, ""let's give thanks to God for that"". He crossed himself, and the three women followed his example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: ""Just look how thin he was. He didn't eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same as when it went in"". Gregor's body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away."
31,44,8,31,2019-02-09,5,"When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: ""Come and 'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"""
32,73,87,32,2019-02-10,5,"""What now, then?"", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils."
33,49,83,33,2019-02-24,4,"He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents ""At last!""."
34,9,197,34,2019-02-24,5,"""Maybe now they'll let me turn round"", thought Gregor and went back to work. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep."
35,59,104,35,2019-02-27,4,"But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked round. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence. His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck."
36,46,8,36,2019-03-05,5,"""It's got to go"", shouted his sister, ""that's the only way, Father. You've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor. We've only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will. We wouldn't have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is this animal is persecuting us, it's driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets. Father, look, just look"", she suddenly screamed, ""he's starting again!"" In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her."
37,11,172,37,2019-03-01,5,"""If he could just understand us"", repeated Gregor's father, closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite impossible, ""then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as it is ..."""
38,52,203,38,2019-02-24,4,"""If he could just understand us"", said his father almost as a question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question."
39,42,170,39,2019-03-01,4,"His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty."
40,15,169,40,2019-03-03,5,"""My child"", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, ""what are we to do?"""
41,58,171,41,2019-02-19,5,"""We have to try and get rid of it"", said Gregor's sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, ""it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we can't endure it. I can't endure it any more."" And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements."
42,32,156,42,2019-03-05,4,"Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile."
43,53,40,43,2019-02-18,5,"""She's absolutely right"", said Gregor's father to himself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes."
44,37,49,44,2019-03-10,5,"""Father, Mother"", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, ""we can't carry on like this. Maybe you can't see it, but I can. I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it. We've done all that's humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong."""
45,59,138,45,2019-02-16,4,"Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor."
46,41,198,46,2019-03-04,5,"The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix—the villagers pronounced this name “Dellacroy”—eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters."
47,47,31,47,2019-02-18,4,"Soon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother’s grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother."
48,32,165,48,2019-03-14,3,"The lottery was conducted—as were the square dances, the teen-age club, the Halloween program—by Mr. Summers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, “Little late today, folks.” The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool, and when Mr. Summers said, “Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?,” there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it."
49,34,58,49,2019-02-18,4,"The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything’s being done. The black box grew shabbier each year; by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained."
50,40,180,50,2019-02-24,5,"Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them into the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers’ coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves’ barn and another year underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there."
51,32,85,51,2019-03-15,4,"There was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up—of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins"
52,72,9,52,2019-03-05,5,"Just as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. “Clean forgot what day it was,” she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. “Thought my old man was out back stacking wood,” Mrs. Hutchinson went on, “and then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running.” She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, “You’re in time, though. They’re still talking away up there.”"
53,10,113,53,2019-03-03,5,"Mrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through; two or three people said, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, “Here comes your Mrs., Hutchinson,” and “Bill, she made it after all.” Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully, “Thought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.” Mrs. Hutchinson said, grinning, “Wouldn’t have me leave m’dishes in the sink, now, would you, Joe?,” and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson’s arrival."
54,66,130,54,2019-03-09,4,"“Me, I guess,” a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. “Wife draws for her husband,” Mr. Summers said. “Don’t you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?” Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered."
55,15,58,55,2019-02-25,5,"The people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions; most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, “Adams.” A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. “Hi, Steve,” Mr. Summers said, and Mr. Adams said, “Hi, Joe.” They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not looking down at his hand."
56,71,20,56,2019-02-21,4,"People began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at the paper in his hand. Suddenly, Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers, “You didn’t give him time enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn’t fair!”"

They go ahead, if they have real faith. Threats, ridicule and dangers do not daunt them. Sometimes they may pause, to renew their courage; but they proceed again on the same line."

284,73,125,284,2019-07-13,3,"ritkán ha megcsendült, az elfulladt vágy s a kivánság olthatatlan kínja,"
285,34,46,285,2019-07-30,4,"mind a szívébe markolt, mind, amint elkábultan és szédüldözve már, egy"
286,57,33,286,2019-08-06,5,falnak dőlt és röhögött:
287,41,198,287,2019-07-29,5,– A pékné!
288,60,156,288,2019-07-19,5,"Hát igen, ott volt előtte, hogyne, a pékné, a túlsó sarkon a"
289,26,85,289,2019-07-30,5,"Király-szinház kapui előtt. A pékné, amint élt s virult, igért és"
290,58,47,290,2019-07-18,5,"hazudott, a pékné, atyám, a kék szemével, a bevont ajkával, a keblének"
291,46,154,291,2019-07-17,5,"két ezüst almájával, a pékné üdén és omlatag fehérben, a hattyuprémek"
292,34,76,292,2019-07-24,5,"fejedelemségében, ott vonult el a tömegben, s a szőke feje ragyogott az"
293,55,142,293,2019-07-26,5,"estében! Elhülve nézte, mozdulatlanul, s magába szítta, mint a fényt. A"
294,43,149,294,2019-08-03,5,"tumultusból kiválasztotta, kiemelte mint egy bálványt, csak őt látta,"
295,72,23,295,2019-07-20,5,"csak őt követte, visszafojtott lélegzettel, a falnak tapadva, hogy meg"
296,65,23,296,2019-07-20,5,"ne zavarja, hogy el ne tünjön s mereven a nyakát kinyujtotta utána, mint"
297,61,63,297,2019-08-10,5,"a ló holtra szomjadtan, az egész nyakát, megnyulva a térben, a torz feje"
298,65,69,298,2019-08-03,1,"vonaglásával. Oh dehogy is tünt el, sőt, enyhén megállott, elbűvölő"
299,7,99,299,2019-07-28,3,"fiatal jelenség, viruló kis polgárasszony a prémjeibe burkoltan s a"
300,35,5,300,2019-08-16,4,"szoknyáját megemelve a zománcos pikkely csillogásával, a pazar ruháját"
301,8,208,301,2019-07-24,5,"két apró lába fölött, melyek leányos kecsességgel, félénken, egymáshoz"
302,57,194,302,2019-07-26,5,"szorultak, mintegy szokatlanul és gène-ben a kövön. És nyugtalan"
303,66,114,303,2019-08-12,5,"elnézett a feltorlódó kocsisoron, amint mögötte s körülötte, a"
304,52,25,304,2019-07-26,5,"Király-szinház kapuján, kitódult a tömeg, a kalapok, ruhák, meztelen"
305,25,140,305,2019-07-23,5,"vállak, kihevült arcok s meglazult hajfürtök százféle formáiban, röpködő"
306,8,78,306,2019-08-16,4,"női tarsolyok és szinházi látcsövek keverékében, színes tolongás az"
307,74,47,307,2019-08-18,5,"éjnek lendülten, betelt örömök hullámzásával."
308,49,46,308,2019-07-30,4,"Kocsit várt, keresett, olykor szólítgatott is, de a hangja alig"
309,10,131,309,2019-08-20,5,"hallatszott a térben, magányos madársipongás szopránja, kis üde női szó,"
310,30,5,310,2019-08-14,5,"ami elveszett. És intett is a gyönyörü karjával, mint az opál"
311,55,141,311,2019-08-08,5,"fényrezgése az éjben, amint kibujt és kinyúlott a prémtömegek, a bő"
312,35,17,312,2019-07-31,5,"ujjak alól, az eleven hús üdeségével. Még nézte onnan, a fal tövéből,"
313,3,84,313,2019-08-19,5,"elfúlva és roskadozva s aztán, hirtelen, áttántorgott hozzá levett"
314,12,69,314,2019-08-23,4,"kalappal, drága ember és megállott előtte meggörbülten. A pékné volt,"
315,17,181,315,2019-08-17,5,"igen a pékné, így közelről is, isteni Rausch Mária asszony, tavaszi"
316,71,60,316,2019-08-11,4,"Mária, mindössze még fehérebben, még vonzóbban, még kedvesebben, az"
317,67,91,317,2019-08-01,5,"ékszerei szikrázásával a prémjei fölött, mint egy királyi ágyastárs,"
318,16,34,318,2019-08-20,4,"derüs, világos, ragyogó, a szőke hajak koronájával. Mit mondjon? Remegő"
319,3,199,319,2019-08-08,5,"ajka, egy-egy csöndes szó formáján vonaglott, az orra megnyult – de hát"
320,69,94,320,2019-08-09,3,"mit mondjon? Mégis, valamit hebegett, valami választ is várt, de a kék"
321,66,160,321,2019-08-26,5,"szemü Mária megriadva nézte, miközben kis nyugtalan mozdulatokkal az"
322,27,159,322,2019-08-03,3,erszényében keresgélt.
323,54,30,323,2019-08-13,5,"IN a gorge of the moors, not far away as the crow flies from Pendle"
324,60,2,324,2019-08-24,4,"Hill, stood a grim, rambling house known to the heath-men as"
325,61,11,325,2019-08-06,4,"Windyhough. It had been fortified once; but afterwards, in times of"
326,49,140,326,2019-08-24,2,"ease, successive owners had thought more of dice and hunting than of"
327,28,96,327,2019-08-24,5,"warfare, and within-doors the house was furnished with a comfort that"
328,46,77,328,2019-08-25,4,belied its loopholed walls.
329,66,173,329,2019-08-17,5,"It stood in the county of Lancaster, famed for its loyalty and for the"
330,8,137,330,2019-09-01,5,beauty of its women--two qualities that often run together--and there
331,2,23,331,2019-08-21,4,had been Royds at Windyhough since Norman William first parcelled out
332,4,24,332,2019-09-01,3,the County Palatine among the strong men of his following. The Royd
333,9,201,333,2019-08-22,4,"pride had been deep enough, yet chivalrous and warm-hearted, as of men"
334,29,57,334,2019-08-28,5,"whose history is an open book, not fearing scrutiny but asking it."
335,21,111,335,2019-08-23,5,"The heir of it all--house, and name, and lusty pride--came swinging"
336,57,164,336,2019-09-02,4,"over the moor-crest that gave him a sight of Windyhough, lying far"
337,52,119,337,2019-08-25,5,below in the haze of the November afternoon. It was not Rupert’s fault
338,34,172,338,2019-09-03,4,"that he was the heir, and less strong of body than others of his race."
339,49,96,339,2019-08-20,5,"It was not his fault that Lady Royd, his mother, had despised him from"
340,51,20,340,2019-08-14,5,"infancy, because he broke the tradition of his house that all its sons"
341,22,122,341,2019-08-15,4,must needs be strong and good to look at.
342,25,65,342,2019-08-13,5,"The heir stood on the windy summit, his gun under his arm, and looked"
343,2,90,343,2019-09-09,4,"over the rolling, never-ending sweep of hills. The sun, big and ruddy,"
344,55,86,344,2019-08-30,5,"was dipping over Pendle’s rounded slope, and all the hollows in between"
345,58,83,345,2019-08-18,5,were luminous and still. He forgot his loneliness--forgot that he could
346,15,97,346,2019-09-02,4,not sit a horse with ease or pleasure to himself; forgot that he was
347,48,63,347,2019-08-17,4,"shy of his equals, shy of the country-folk who met him on the road,"
348,55,30,348,2019-08-20,5,that his one respite from the burden of the day was to get up into the
349,10,100,349,2019-08-29,5,hills which God had set there for a sanctuary.
350,48,16,350,2019-08-27,4,"Very still, and straight to his full height, this man of"
351,36,38,351,2019-08-29,5,five-and-twenty stood watching the pageant of the sun’s down-going.
352,45,185,352,2019-09-10,5,"It was home and liberty to him, this rough land where all was peat"
353,30,21,353,2019-09-13,4,"and heather, and the running cry of streams afraid of loneliness, and"
354,62,126,354,2019-08-23,5,overhead the snow-clouds thrusting forward from the east across the
355,11,35,355,2019-08-29,4,"western splendour of blue, and red, and sapphire."
356,44,58,356,2019-09-11,3,"He shivered suddenly. As of old, his soul was bigger than the strength"
357,35,121,357,2019-08-24,4,"of his lean body, and he looked down at Windyhough with misgiving, for"
358,3,127,358,2019-08-24,5,he was spent with hunger and long walking over the hills he loved.
359,46,205,359,2019-09-14,4,"He thought of his father, kind always and tolerant of his heir’s"
360,25,4,360,2019-08-25,5,"infirmities; of his mother, colder than winter on the hills; of"
361,2,96,361,2019-09-08,5,"Maurice, his younger brother by three years, who could ride well, could"
362,74,91,362,2019-08-30,4,"show prowess in field-sports, and in all things carry himself like the"
363,12,57,363,2019-09-18,5,true heir of Windyhough.
364,60,19,364,2019-09-09,4,"A quick, unreasoning hatred of Maurice took him unawares--Esau’s"
365,36,17,365,2019-08-28,3,hate for the supplanter. He remembered that Maurice had never known
366,28,137,366,2019-09-11,5,the fears that bodily weakness brings. In nursery days he had been
367,18,196,367,2019-08-30,4,"the leader, claiming the toys he coveted; in boyhood he had been the"
368,43,177,368,2019-09-16,3,"friend and intimate of older men, who laughed at his straightforward"
369,58,203,369,2019-09-18,4,"fearlessness, and told each other, while the heir stood by and"
370,37,178,370,2019-09-08,3,"listened, that Maurice was a pup of the old breed."
371,64,84,371,2019-08-30,4,"There was comfort blowing down the wind to Rupert, had he guessed it."
372,11,114,372,2019-09-23,5,"The moor loves her own, as human mothers do, and in her winter-time"
373,21,38,373,2019-09-21,5,"she meant to prove him. He did not guess as much, as he looked down"
374,46,141,374,2019-09-13,5,"on the huddled chimney-stacks of Windyhough, and saw the grey smoke"
375,3,202,375,2019-09-10,3,"flying wide above the gables. His heart was there, down yonder where"
376,10,199,376,2019-09-13,5,"the old house laughed slyly to know that he was heir to it, instead"
377,17,103,377,2019-09-21,5,"of Maurice. If only he could take his full share in field-sports, and"
378,69,145,378,2019-09-03,5,meet his fellows with the frank laugh of comradeship--if he had been
379,67,191,379,2019-09-20,5,"less sensitive to ridicule, to the self-distrust inbred in him by Lady"
380,19,168,380,2019-10-03,5,Royd’s disdain--his world might have worn a different face to-day. He
381,16,20,381,2019-09-17,5,"stooped to pat the setter that had shared a day’s poor sport with him,"
382,27,206,382,2019-10-05,5,and then again his thoughts went roving down the years.
383,13,17,383,2019-09-10,5,"He did not hear the sound of hoofs behind him, till Roger Demaine’s"
384,29,60,384,2019-09-29,5,"daughter rode close up, reined in, and sat regarding him with an odd"
385,28,149,385,2019-09-11,4,"look of pity, and liking, and reproach."
386,43,92,386,2019-10-05,5,"“You look out of heart, Rupert. What ails you?” she asked, startling"
387,62,141,387,2019-09-26,4,him out of his day-dream.
388,33,15,388,2019-10-05,5,"“Life. It is life that ails me,” he muttered, then laughed as if"
389,61,174,389,2019-09-20,4,ashamed of his quick outburst. “I’ve been tramping the moors since
390,39,107,390,2019-09-14,5,"daybreak, Nance,” he went on, in a matter-of-fact voice, “and all for"
391,53,101,391,2019-09-22,4,three brace of grouse. You know how much powder goes to every bird I
392,43,72,392,2019-09-21,5,kill.”
393,4,158,393,2019-10-06,4,"“But, Rupert, why are you so bitter?”"
394,68,83,394,2019-09-17,5,"“Because I’m your fool,” he broke in, with easy irony. “Oh, they think"
395,28,202,395,2019-09-20,4,I do not know! They call me the scholar--or the dreamer--or any other
396,17,163,396,2019-10-08,5,"name--but we know what they mean, Nance.”"
397,59,154,397,2019-10-14,4,The girl’s face was grave and puzzled. Through all the years they had
398,15,159,398,2019-10-11,3,"known each other, he and she, he had seldom shown her a glimpse of"
399,71,38,399,2019-10-13,5,this passionate rebellion against the world that hemmed him in. And it
400,40,125,400,2019-10-16,2,was true--pitiably true. She had seen men smile good-naturedly when
401,51,80,401,2019-10-17,4,"his name was spoken--good-naturedly, because all men liked him in some"
402,9,140,402,2019-09-21,5,"affectionate, unquestioning way--had heard them ask each other what the"
403,24,153,403,2019-09-28,5,"Royds had done in times past to deserve such ill-luck as this heir, who"
404,65,175,404,2019-10-17,4,was fit only for the cloisters where scholars walked apart and read old
405,9,160,405,2019-10-04,4,tomes.
406,30,183,406,2019-09-28,5,"And yet, for some odd reason, she liked him better for the outburst."
407,14,194,407,2019-09-25,5,"Here on his own moors, with the tiredness in his face and the ring of"
408,12,81,408,2019-10-13,5,"courage in his voice, she saw the manhood in him."
409,13,105,409,2019-10-14,5,"“Rupert,” she said, glancing backward, and laughing to hide her stress"
410,26,78,410,2019-10-05,5,of feeling. “You’ve lost me a race to-day.”
411,16,126,411,2019-10-10,5,"“Very likely,” he said, yielding still to his evil humour. “I was"
412,65,115,412,2019-10-09,5,"always in the way, Nance. My lady mother told me as much, no longer ago"
413,13,4,413,2019-10-10,5,"than yesterday. This race of yours?” he added, tired of himself, tired"
414,25,207,414,2019-10-08,5,"of the comrade moor, weary even of Nance Demaine, who was his first"
415,38,169,415,2019-10-10,1,"love and who would likely, if he died in his bed at ninety, be his last."
416,67,155,416,2019-10-13,5,"She glanced over her shoulder again, and saw two horsemen cantering"
417,55,8,417,2019-10-05,5,"half a mile away through the crimson sunset-glow. “It was a good wager,"
418,38,194,418,2019-10-08,5,"Rupert, and you’ve spoilt it. The hunt was all amiss to-day--whenever"
419,5,126,419,2019-10-05,5,"we found a fox, we lost him after a mile or two--and Will Underwood and"
420,14,101,420,2019-10-15,1,"your brother, as we rode home----”"
421,46,198,421,2019-10-20,5,"“My brother, and Will Underwood--yes. They hunt in couples always.”"
422,41,41,422,2019-10-28,5,"“Be patient, Rupert! Your temper is on edge. I’ve never known it fail"
423,2,171,423,2019-10-10,5,you until to-day.”
424,6,177,424,2019-10-29,5,"“Fools are not supposed to show temper,” he put in dryly. “It is only"
425,39,66,425,2019-10-03,4,wise men who’re allowed to ride their humours on a loose rein. So you
426,9,85,426,2019-10-07,4,"had a wager, Nance?”"
427,58,107,427,2019-10-28,4,"“Yes. We had had no real gallop; so, coming home, Maurice said that he"
428,52,112,428,2019-10-12,4,would give me a fair start--as far as Intake Farm--and the first home
429,33,72,429,2019-10-12,4,to father’s house should----”
430,71,172,430,2019-10-30,4,"She halted, ashamed, somehow, of Rupert’s steady glance."
431,67,26,431,2019-10-09,4,“And the wager?”
432,48,17,432,2019-10-14,4,"She glanced behind her. The two horsemen were climbing Lone Man’s Hill,"
433,32,111,433,2019-10-09,4,"and the sight of them, just showing over the red, sunset top, gave her"
434,6,46,434,2019-10-18,3,"new courage. “You’re brave, Rupert, and I was full of laughter till you"
435,16,53,435,2019-10-12,4,spoiled my ride. It was so slight a wager. Maurice has a rough-haired
436,15,160,436,2019-10-12,3,"terrier I covet. If--Rupert, you look as if I were a sinner"
437,18,199,437,2019-10-28,4,"absolute--if I were first home, Maurice was to give me the dog--and, if"
438,45,196,438,2019-10-24,3,not----”
439,61,189,439,2019-10-13,4,“And if not?”
440,59,179,440,2019-10-30,5,She was dismayed by his cold air of question. “If I lost the wager?
441,52,207,441,2019-11-03,5,"Your brother was to have my glove. What harm was there? He’s a boy,"
442,66,135,442,2019-10-23,5,"Rupert--besides,” she added, with the unheeding coquetry that was"
443,52,165,443,2019-10-28,5,"constantly leading her astray, “it is you who make me lose the wager."
444,63,176,444,2019-10-21,5,"See them, how close they are! And I’d kept my lead so splendidly until"
445,50,68,445,2019-10-30,5,you checked me.”
446,47,24,446,2019-10-17,5,"He was not heeding her. His eyes were fixed on the upcoming horsemen,"
447,29,12,447,2019-10-19,5,"and Nance could not understand this new, tense mood of his. It was only"
448,36,158,448,2019-11-07,5,when Will Underwood and young Maurice reined up beside them that she
449,73,28,449,2019-10-20,5,"knew there was trouble brewing, as surely as snow was coming with the"
450,23,7,450,2019-11-02,5,rising wind.
451,55,83,451,2019-10-23,5,"“We’ve caught you, Nance,” laughed Maurice. “Will you settle the wager"
452,64,52,452,2019-10-25,1,"now, or later?”"
453,71,69,453,2019-11-12,3,"He was big and buoyant, this lad of two-and-twenty. Life had used him"
454,3,208,454,2019-10-29,4,"well, had given him a hale body, and nerves like whipcord, and a good"
455,39,3,455,2019-10-30,5,temper that needed little discipline to train it into shape.
456,66,113,456,2019-11-15,5,"Will Underwood laughed. “Best hasten, Maurice, or I’ll claim the"
457,64,114,457,2019-10-21,5,forfeit for you.”
458,34,123,458,2019-11-09,5,Rupert glanced from Will Underwood to Maurice. There was no hurry in
459,9,62,459,2019-11-14,5,"his glance, only a wish to strike, and a temperate, quiet question as"
460,73,89,460,2019-10-29,4,"to which enemy he should choose. Then, suddenly, the indignities of"
461,25,64,461,2019-10-22,5,years gone by came to a head. He recalled the constant yielding to his
462,61,43,462,2019-10-29,4,"brother, the gibes he had let pass without retaliation, the long tale"
463,16,109,463,2019-10-30,5,"of renunciation, weakness."
464,24,36,464,2019-10-23,5,"“Maurice,” he said, with a straightening of his shoulders, “I want a"
465,24,106,465,2019-11-10,2,"word with you. Mr. Underwood, you will ride home with Nance? We shall"
466,21,27,466,2019-11-19,5,not need you.”
467,41,205,467,2019-10-30,5,"Will Underwood gave a smothered laugh, but Nance was grave. She looked"
468,69,135,468,2019-11-09,4,"first at Maurice’s boyish, puzzled face, then at Rupert."
469,23,189,469,2019-10-28,5,"“I claim your escort, Mr. Underwood,” she said sharply."
470,71,109,470,2019-10-30,4,Some reproof in her tone ruffled Will Underwood and kept him silent as
471,55,41,471,2019-11-04,5,"they rode over the crest of the moor and down the long, rough slopes"
472,62,188,472,2019-11-15,4,that led them to the pastures. He was assured of his reputation as
473,38,156,473,2019-10-29,5,a hard rider and a man of the world; and it piqued him to be given
474,26,47,474,2019-11-13,3,marching orders by a boy of five-and-twenty.
475,64,175,475,2019-11-05,5,"“Rupert thought himself his own father just now, Miss Demaine,” he"
476,69,48,476,2019-11-11,3,"said in his deep, pleasant voice. “For the first time since I’ve known"
477,65,13,477,2019-11-14,5,"him, he had something of the grand air. What mischief are the two lads"
478,2,101,478,2019-11-03,4,getting into up yonder?”
479,43,18,479,2019-11-05,4,"Nance did not know her own mood. She seemed to be free, for the moment,"
480,10,200,480,2019-11-12,3,"of her light-hearted, healthy girlhood, seemed to be looking, old and"
481,44,98,481,2019-11-01,5,"wise, into some muddled picture of the days to come. “No mischief,”"
482,55,126,482,2019-11-24,4,"she answered, as if some other than herself were speaking. “Rupert is"
483,71,156,483,2019-11-16,5,"finding his road to the grand air, as you call it. It is a steep road,"
484,67,74,484,2019-11-02,5,I fancy.”
485,9,116,485,2019-11-15,4,Up on the moor Maurice was facing his elder brother. “What fool’s play
486,48,165,486,2019-11-27,3,"is this, Rupert?” he asked. “Why don’t you hunt instead of prowling up"
487,34,131,487,2019-11-18,4,and down the moor with a gun till your wits are addled? Your face is
488,74,112,488,2019-11-13,5,like a hatchet.”
489,68,164,489,2019-11-14,5,"“You made a wager?” said Rupert, with the same desperate quiet."
490,33,154,490,2019-11-24,4,"“Yes, and I’ve won it. Come, old monk, admit there are worse gloves to"
491,25,171,491,2019-11-16,5,claim in Lancashire.”
492,2,151,492,2019-11-22,4,"Rupert winced. His thoughts of Nance Demaine were so long, so fragrant."
493,66,52,493,2019-11-13,5,"Since his boyhood struggled first into the riper understanding, he had"
494,67,34,494,2019-12-03,5,cloistered her image from the world’s rough usage. She had been to him
495,20,150,495,2019-12-03,4,"something magical, unattainable, and he was paying now for an homage"
496,31,5,496,2019-11-30,5,"less healthy than this world’s needs demand. It was all so trifling,"
497,35,31,497,2019-12-08,4,this happy-go-lucky wager of a dog against a glove; but he saw in it a
498,25,192,498,2019-11-20,5,supplanting more bitter than any that had gone before.
499,69,108,499,2019-11-17,5,"He stood there for a moment, irresolute, bound by old subservience"
500,53,134,500,2019-12-04,4,"to Maurice, by remembrance of his weakness and his nickname of “the"
501,22,189,501,2019-11-29,4,"scholar.” Then the moor whispered in his ear, told him to be a fool no"
502,31,111,502,2019-12-06,5,longer; and a strength that was almost gaiety came to him.
503,59,164,503,2019-11-20,5,"“Get out of the saddle, Maurice,” he said peremptorily. “I want to"
504,42,137,504,2019-12-07,4,talk to you on foot.”
505,35,99,505,2019-12-10,5,"Maurice obeyed by instinct, as if a ghost had met him in the open and"
506,72,82,506,2019-12-07,5,startled him. Here was the scholar--the brother whom he could not any
507,24,150,507,2019-11-19,4,"way despise, because he loved him--with a red spot of colour in each"
508,19,83,508,2019-12-13,5,"cheek, and in his voice the ring of true metal."
509,37,12,509,2019-11-27,4,“Well?” asked the younger.
510,70,159,510,2019-11-30,3,“You never would have claimed that glove.”
511,40,9,511,2019-12-10,4,"The boy’s temper, easy-going as it was, was roused. “Would _you_ have"
512,51,30,512,2019-12-01,5,hindered me?”
513,52,191,513,2019-11-23,4,“Yes. I--I love her. That is all.”
514,35,44,514,2019-11-30,5,"So young Maurice laughed aloud, and Rupert ran in suddenly and hit him"
515,55,115,515,2019-12-09,5,"on the mouth, and the fight began. In his dreams the heir of Windyhough"
516,43,2,516,2019-12-03,4,"had revelled in battles, in swift assaults, forlorn and desperate"
517,62,113,517,2019-12-11,5,"hopes; for he had known no waking pleasures of the kind. And always, in"
518,20,48,518,2019-12-17,4,"his dreams, there had been a certain spaciousness and leisure; he had"
519,6,81,519,2019-12-12,3,"found time, in between giving and receiving blows, to feel himself the"
520,66,180,520,2019-11-30,5,"big man of his hands, to revel in the sheer bravery of the thing."
521,44,123,521,2019-11-29,4,"In practice, here on the open moor, with snow coming up across the"
522,31,199,522,2019-12-10,3,"stormy, steel-grey sky, there was no leisure and no illusion. He had"
523,34,207,523,2019-12-21,4,"no time to feel, no luxury of sentiment. He knew only that, in some"
524,71,132,524,2019-11-26,3,"muddled way, he was fighting Nance’s battle; that, by some miracle, he"
525,20,108,525,2019-12-15,4,got a sharp blow home at times; that twice Maurice knocked him down;
526,17,191,526,2019-12-04,5,"that, by some native stubbornness, he got up again, with the moor"
527,47,120,527,2019-12-25,5,"dancing in wide circles round him, and hit his man."
528,43,132,528,2019-12-23,5,"It was swift and soon over, as Rupert thought of this battle"
529,36,143,529,2019-12-24,5,"afterwards. No pipes were playing up and down the hills, to hearten"
530,31,102,530,2019-12-14,5,"him. Even the wind, whose note he loved, blew swift from the east about"
531,26,126,531,2019-12-23,5,"deaf ears. He and his brother were alone, in a turmoil of their own"
532,46,57,532,2019-12-03,5,"making, and his weakening arms were beating like a flail about the head"
533,59,25,533,2019-12-29,5,"of Maurice, the supplanter. Then the moors whirled round him, a world"
534,57,203,534,2019-12-27,5,"big with portent and disaster; and dimly, as from a long way off, he"
535,68,126,535,2019-12-22,5,heard Maurice’s voice.
536,39,61,536,2019-12-07,5,“I’ll have to kill him before he gives in. Who ever thought it of the
537,39,154,537,2019-12-06,5,scholar?”
538,63,62,538,2019-12-14,5,"The gibe heartened Rupert. He struggled up again, and by sheer"
539,57,185,539,2019-12-24,4,"instinct--skill he had little, and strength seemed to have left him"
540,38,116,540,2020-01-01,5,long ago--he got another swift blow home. And then darkness settled on
541,21,17,541,2019-12-09,4,"him, and he dreamed again of battle as he had known it in the fanciful"
542,44,171,542,2019-12-13,5,"days of boyhood. He revelled in this lonely moorland fight, counted"
543,35,111,543,2019-12-26,4,"again each blow and wondered at its strength, knew himself at last a"
544,14,105,544,2019-12-15,5,proven man. His dreams were kind to him.
545,71,6,545,2020-01-07,4,"Then he got out from his sickness, little by little, and looked about"
546,70,47,546,2019-12-25,5,"him, and saw a half-moon shining dimly through a whirl of snow. The"
547,9,22,547,2019-12-24,4,"east wind was playing shrewdly round his battered face, as if a man"
548,53,157,548,2019-12-19,5,"were rubbing salt into his wounds. He tried to get up, looked about him"
549,50,202,549,2019-12-18,4,"again, and saw Maurice stooping over him."
550,56,46,550,2020-01-02,5,"A long glance passed between the brothers, Rupert lying on the heather,"
551,56,11,551,2019-12-26,4,Maurice kneeling in the sleety moonlight. There was question in the
552,53,106,552,2019-12-19,3,"glance, old affection, some trouble of the jealousy that had bidden"
553,62,71,553,2019-12-18,5,"them fight just now. Then a little sob, of which he was ashamed,"
554,9,115,554,2020-01-12,2,escaped the younger brother.
555,50,129,555,2020-01-06,4,Rupert struggled to a sitting posture. He could do no more as yet. “So
556,29,55,556,2019-12-21,5,I’m not just the scholar?” he asked feebly.
557,66,182,557,2020-01-12,5,"Maurice, young as he was, was troubled by the vehemence, the"
558,3,203,558,2019-12-26,4,"wistfulness, of the appeal. Odd chords were stirred, under the"
559,11,131,559,2019-12-28,4,rough-and-ready view he had of life. This brother with whom he had
560,54,158,560,2019-12-29,5,"fought just now--he understood, in a dim way, the pity and the"
561,43,128,561,2020-01-18,5,"isolation of his life, understood the daily suffering he had undergone."
562,21,160,562,2020-01-09,5,"Then, suddenly and as if to seek relief from too much feeling, the"
563,31,204,563,2020-01-06,5,younger brother laughed.
564,74,45,564,2019-12-30,5,"“The next time a man sneers at you for being a scholar, Rupert, give"
565,41,137,565,2020-01-05,5,him a straight answer.”
566,28,20,566,2020-01-18,5,"“Yes?” The heir of Windyhough was dazed and muddled still, though he"
567,21,5,567,2019-12-28,5,had got to his feet again.
568,52,149,568,2020-01-02,5,"“Hit him once between the eyes. A liar seldom asks a second blow, so"
569,52,36,569,2019-12-26,1,father says.”
570,40,94,570,2019-12-27,5,"Then a silence fell between them, while the last of the sunset red grew"
571,16,95,571,2019-12-30,5,"pale about the swarthy line of heath above them, and the moon sailed"
572,24,4,572,2020-01-15,5,dim and phantom-like through the sleety clouds. They had been fond of
573,38,34,573,2020-01-05,5,"each other always, but now some deeper love, some intimate communion,"
574,30,137,574,2019-12-28,5,gathered the years up and bound them into lasting friendship. Maurice
575,35,85,575,2020-01-14,5,"had been jealous of his brother’s heirship, contemptuous of his"
576,47,31,576,2020-01-19,5,"scholarship. And Rupert had been sick at heart, these years past,"
577,51,110,577,2019-12-28,5,"knowing how well the supplanter sat his horse, and carried a gun, and"
578,42,31,578,2020-01-22,5,did all things reckoned worthy.
579,31,129,579,2020-01-03,4,"And now they met on equal terms. They had fought together, man against"
580,49,188,580,2020-01-11,4,man; and their love ripened under the bitter east wind and the stinging
581,56,201,581,2020-01-08,4,"sleet, as the man’s way is."
582,61,139,582,2020-01-12,4,"They went down the moor together, Maurice leading his horse by the"
583,24,111,583,2020-01-16,4,"bridle. They were no heroic figures, the three of them. The horse was"
584,29,160,584,2020-01-10,4,"shivering, after long waiting in the cold while his master settled"
585,65,8,585,2020-01-23,4,private differences; and the two brothers limped and stumbled as they
586,29,41,586,2020-01-06,4,picked their way down the white slope of the moor. There was no speed
587,51,44,587,2020-01-15,4,"of action now; there was, instead, this slow march home that in its"
588,64,175,588,2020-01-16,3,very forlornness touched some subtle note of humour. Yet Rupert was
589,12,109,589,2020-01-30,4,"warm, as if he sat by a peat-fire; for he felt a man’s soul stirring in"
590,25,132,590,2020-01-15,3,him.
591,25,119,591,2020-01-31,4,“What did we fight about?” asked Maurice suddenly. “The fun was so hot
592,67,10,592,2020-01-31,3,"while it lasted--and, gad, Rupert, I’ve forgotten what the quarrel was.”"
593,61,177,593,2020-01-13,4,"Again the elder brother grew quick, alert. It seemed he was ready to"
594,44,152,594,2020-01-31,5,"provoke a second fight. “It was Nance’s glove,” he said quietly. “You"
595,60,100,595,2020-02-01,5,"said you meant to claim it, and I said not. I say it still.”"
596,34,70,596,2020-01-31,5,"“There, there, old lad!” laughed Maurice, patting him lightly on the"
597,20,183,597,2020-01-18,5,shoulder. “You shall have the glove. She’d rather give it to you than
598,28,149,598,2020-01-31,5,"to any man in Lancashire. I said as much to Will Underwood just now,"
599,53,123,599,2020-01-24,5,and he didn’t relish it.”
600,63,104,600,2020-01-21,5,"“Rather give it me?” echoed the other, with entire simplicity. “I can"
601,39,194,601,2020-02-01,5,"do nothing that a woman asks, Maurice.”"
602,69,107,602,2020-01-22,5,"A sudden dizziness crossed his eagerness. He could not keep the path,"
603,36,124,603,2020-02-07,5,until Maurice steadied him.
604,66,10,604,2020-02-04,5,"“You can hit devilish hard,” said the younger dryly."
605,71,46,605,2020-02-08,5,"The three of them went down the moor, counting the furlongs miles. And"
606,48,124,606,2020-01-26,1,"again the brothers met on equal terms; for each was bruised and hungry,"
607,12,177,607,2020-01-21,3,"and body-sickness, if it strike deep enough, is apt to bring wayfarers"
608,63,176,608,2020-02-11,4,to one common level.
609,24,24,609,2020-02-12,5,"Nance and Will Underwood had reached the lower lands by now, and she"
610,11,46,610,2020-01-19,5,turned to him at the gate of Demaine House with some reluctance.
611,57,183,611,2020-01-23,5,"“You will let my father thank you for your escort?” she asked, stroking"
612,33,41,612,2020-01-30,5,her mare’s neck.
613,48,206,613,2020-01-26,5,"“I’ll come in,” he answered, with the rollicking assurance that"
614,24,98,614,2020-01-26,4,endeared him to the hard riders of the county--“if only for an hour
615,42,58,615,2020-01-25,5,"more with you.” He leaned across and touched her bridle-hand. “Nance,"
616,12,167,616,2020-02-02,4,you’ve treated me all amiss these last days. You never give me a word
617,49,84,617,2020-02-19,5,"apart, and there’s so much----”"
618,17,60,618,2020-01-30,4,"“I’m tired and cold,” she broke in, wayward and sleety as this moorland"
619,27,2,619,2020-01-29,4,that had cradled her. “You may spare me--what shall I say?--the
620,51,41,620,2020-02-10,5,"flattery that Mr. Underwood gives every woman, when other women are not"
621,35,64,621,2020-01-30,4,there to hear.”
622,50,173,622,2020-02-12,5,She did not know what ailed her. Until an hour ago she had been
623,5,186,623,2020-02-08,4,"yielding, little by little, to the suit which Will Underwood had"
624,19,83,624,2020-02-08,4,"pressed on her--in season and out, as his way was. There had been"
625,49,20,625,2020-02-11,4,"sudden withdrawals, gusts of coquetry, on her part; for the woman’s"
626,37,118,626,2020-02-07,5,"flight at all times is like a snipe’s--zig-zag, and only to be reckoned"
627,62,75,627,2020-02-25,5,with according to the rule of contraries.
628,25,203,628,2020-02-13,5,"But now, as she went into the house, not asking but simply permitting"
629,51,188,629,2020-02-02,5,"him to follow her, there was a real avoidance of him. She could not"
630,73,180,630,2020-02-20,5,"rid herself of the picture of Rupert, standing desolate up yonder on"
631,35,11,631,2020-02-23,4,"the empty moors--Rupert, who was heir to traditions of hard riding and"
632,8,17,632,2020-02-07,4,"hard fighting; Rupert, with the eyes of a dreamer and the behaviour of"
633,39,80,633,2020-02-23,5,a hermit. She wondered what he and Maurice were doing on the moor. His
634,31,64,634,2020-02-28,4,last words had not suggested need of her--had hinted plainly that he
635,67,37,635,2020-02-28,4,had a man’s work to do.
636,64,201,636,2020-02-22,4,Her father was in the hall as they came in. A glance at his face told
637,71,187,637,2020-02-14,4,"her that Roger Demaine was in no mood for trifles, and she stood apart,"
638,26,142,638,2020-02-22,4,"willingly enough, while he gravely offered wine to Underwood, and"
639,24,138,639,2020-03-01,4,"filled his glass for him, and scarcely paused to let him set lips to it"
640,51,7,640,2020-02-25,5,before he ran into the middle of his tale.
641,2,88,641,2020-02-10,5,“There’s muddled news from Scotland. I can’t make head or tail of
642,46,44,642,2020-02-15,4,"it,” he said, glancing sharply round to see that no servants were in"
643,70,54,643,2020-02-29,5,"earshot. “We expected him to come south with the New Year, and I’ve had"
644,21,148,644,2020-02-17,4,word just now that he’ll be riding through Lancashire before the month
645,42,7,645,2020-02-27,5,is out--that he means to keep Christmas in high state in London.”
646,54,156,646,2020-02-08,5,"“I’ll not believe it,” said Will Underwood lazily. “The clans up yonder"
647,11,183,647,2020-02-11,5,need more than a week or two to rally to the muster.”
648,20,91,648,2020-02-13,5,"“You were always slow to believe,” snapped the Squire. “Have a care,"
649,40,39,649,2020-03-03,4,"Will, or they’ll say you’re like nine men out of ten--loyal only until"
650,71,132,650,2020-03-04,5,the test comes.”
651,37,52,651,2020-02-13,4,"The other glanced at Nance, then at his host. “I would not permit the"
652,67,100,652,2020-02-26,5,"insult from a younger man, sir,” he said."
653,33,42,653,2020-02-27,5,"“Oh, fiddle-de-dee!” broke in old Roger. “Fine phrases don’t win"
654,10,34,654,2020-03-02,4,"battles, and never did. Insult? None intended, Will. But I’m sick with"
655,27,178,655,2020-02-13,5,"anxiety, and you younger men are the devil and all when you’re asked to"
656,31,125,656,2020-03-02,4,ride on some one else’s errand than your own.”
657,51,105,657,2020-03-02,4,"Roger Demaine, big of height and girth, his face a fine, fox-hunter’s"
658,33,35,658,2020-03-03,4,"red, stood palpably for the old race of squires. In his life there were"
659,34,185,659,2020-03-07,5,mistakes enough--mistakes of impulse and of an uncurbed temper--but
660,12,100,660,2020-03-09,5,there was no pandering to shame of any sort.
661,62,90,661,2020-02-16,5,"“When I’m asked, sir, I shall answer,” said Will Underwood, moving"
662,6,132,662,2020-02-16,4,restlessly from foot to foot.
663,8,119,663,2020-03-05,5,"“Well, I hope so. You’ll not plead, eh, that you are pledged to hunt"
664,63,43,664,2020-03-14,5,"six days a week, and cannot come? that you’ve a snug house and some"
665,12,12,665,2020-03-11,4,"thought of bringing a wife to it one day, and cannot come? that you are"
666,14,18,666,2020-02-23,5,"training a dog to the gun, and cannot come----”"
667,23,145,667,2020-02-27,5,"It was Nance who broke in now. She had forgotten Rupert, standing"
668,38,105,668,2020-03-03,5,hungry and forlorn up the high moor and looking down on his inheritance
669,59,143,669,2020-03-19,4,of Windyhough. Her old liking for Will Underwood--a liking that had
670,38,81,670,2020-03-09,5,"come near, during these last days, to love and hero-worship--bade her"
671,2,175,671,2020-03-22,5,defend their guest against a tongue that was sharper than her father
672,32,17,672,2020-03-17,5,guessed.
673,42,69,673,2020-03-20,4,"“I _know_ he will be true. Why should you doubt him, father?”"
674,70,111,674,2020-02-28,4,"“Oh, there, child! Who said I doubted him? It’s the whole younger race"
675,27,186,675,2020-03-18,5,"of men I distrust. Will here must be scapegoat--and, by that token,"
676,18,3,676,2020-03-11,5,"your glass is empty, Will.”"
677,59,5,677,2020-02-28,5,"With entire disregard of anything that had gone before, Squire Demaine"
678,59,73,678,2020-03-22,4,"filled another measure for his guest, pointed to the chair across the"
679,45,198,679,2020-03-22,5,"hearth, and was about to give the news from Scotland, word by word,"
680,1,54,680,2020-03-22,4,"when he remembered Nance. “It will be only recruiting-talk, Nance--men"
681,22,159,681,2020-03-02,5,"to be counted on in one place, and men we doubt in t’other. It would"
682,62,68,682,2020-03-04,5,only weary you.”
683,73,147,683,2020-03-17,5,"Nance came and stood between them, slim and passionate. “I choose to"
684,44,29,684,2020-03-25,4,"stay, father. Your talk of men, of arms hidden in the hay-mows and the"
685,32,10,685,2020-03-17,5,"byres, of the marching-out--that is your part of the battle. But what"
686,48,42,686,2020-03-11,4,afterwards?”
687,44,132,687,2020-03-10,5,"They glanced at her in some perplexity. She was so resolute, yet so"
688,1,47,688,2020-03-15,4,"remote, in her eager beauty, from the highways that men tramp when"
689,48,115,689,2020-03-21,5,civil war is going forward.
690,16,167,690,2020-03-18,4,"“What afterwards?” grumbled Squire Roger. “Well, the right King on the"
691,29,43,691,2020-03-13,5,"throne again, we hope. What else, my girl?”"
692,39,2,692,2020-03-11,4,"“After you’ve gone, father, and left the house to its women? I’m"
693,51,165,693,2020-03-11,5,"mistress here, since--since mother died.”"
694,5,62,694,2020-03-24,4,"Roger Demaine got to his feet hurriedly and took a pinch of snuff. “Oh,"
695,53,51,695,2020-03-28,5,"have a care, Nance!” he protested noisily. “There’s no need to remind"
696,63,130,696,2020-03-25,4,me that your mother died. I should have taken a whole heart to the
697,60,178,697,2020-03-11,5,"Rising, instead of half o’ one, if she’d been alive.”"
698,70,14,698,2020-03-29,4,"Nance touched his hair lightly, in quick repentance of the hurt she had"
699,19,82,699,2020-03-21,5,given him. But she would not yield her point. “I shall be left mistress
700,7,80,700,2020-04-01,5,here--mistress of a house made up of women and old men--and you? You
701,22,58,701,2020-03-25,4,"will be out in the open, giving blows instead of nursing patience by"
702,31,112,702,2020-03-22,4,the hearth.”
703,60,77,703,2020-03-24,5,"“Perhaps--Nance, perhaps the Rising will not need us, after all,” said"
704,35,163,704,2020-03-19,4,"Will Underwood, with a lame attempt to shirk the issue."
705,38,92,705,2020-03-23,5,"“I trust that it will need you, sir--will need us both,” she said,"
706,24,119,706,2020-03-14,4,flinging round on him with the speed of her father’s temper. “You
707,29,39,707,2020-03-15,5,"thought I complained of the loneliness that is coming? No--but, if I’m"
708,17,124,708,2020-03-22,5,"to take part in your war, I’ll know what news you have.”"
709,28,102,709,2020-03-31,4,"Roger Demaine patted her gently on the shoulder, and smiled as if he"
710,44,119,710,2020-03-29,5,watched a kitten playing antics with a serious face. “The child is
711,52,54,711,2020-03-21,5,"right, Will,” he said. “It will be long and lonely for her, come to"
712,69,189,712,2020-04-02,4,"think of it, and there’s no harm in telling her the news.”"
713,23,193,713,2020-03-28,4,"“Who was the messenger, father?” she asked, leaning against the mantel"
714,52,186,714,2020-04-13,4,and looking down into the blazing log-fire.
715,14,96,715,2020-03-21,4,"“Oh, Oliphant of Muirhouse, from the Annan country. The best horseman"
716,28,30,716,2020-04-03,4,"north of the Solway, they say. He was only here for as long as his"
717,18,112,717,2020-03-29,4,"message lasted, and off again for Sir Jasper’s at Windyhough.”"
718,42,10,718,2020-04-09,4,"“And his news?” asked Will Underwood, watching the fire-glow play about"
719,62,165,719,2020-03-24,4,Nance’s clear-cut face and maidish figure.
720,33,153,720,2020-03-27,4,"The Squire drew them close to him, and glanced about him again and, for"
721,57,34,721,2020-04-01,5,"all his would-be secrecy, his voice rang like a trumpet-call before he"
722,20,22,722,2020-04-19,4,had half told them of the doings up in Scotland. For his loyalty was
723,40,82,723,2020-04-03,4,sane and vastly simple.
724,13,110,724,2020-04-07,4,"They were silent for a while, until Nance turned slowly and stood"
725,63,44,725,2020-03-27,5,looking at the two men. “It is all like a dream come true. The hunger
726,70,141,726,2020-04-07,5,"and the ache, father--the King in name reigning it here, and that other"
727,28,175,727,2020-04-09,2,overseas--and grooms riding while their masters walk----”
728,40,3,728,2020-04-14,5,"“We’ll soon be up in saddle again,” broke in old Roger brusquely."
729,15,104,729,2020-04-11,5,“Oliphant of Muirhouse brings us news that will end all that. The
730,51,39,730,2020-04-10,5,"country disaffected, the old loyalty waiting for a breeze to stir"
731,37,145,731,2020-04-16,4,"it--how can we fail? I tell you there’s to be another Restoration, and"
732,38,37,732,2020-04-17,5,all the church bells ringing.”
733,54,35,733,2020-04-11,5,"He halted, glancing at Will Underwood, who was pacing up and down the"
734,27,93,734,2020-04-24,4,room.
735,14,61,735,2020-04-23,4,"“You’ve the look of a trapped wild-cat, Will,” he said irascibly. “I"
736,19,26,736,2020-04-03,4,"fancied my news would please you--but, dear God, you younger men are"
737,46,180,737,2020-04-06,5,cold! You can follow your fox over hedge and dyke and take all risks.
738,46,54,738,2020-04-04,5,It’s only when the big hunt is up that you begin to count the value of
739,65,103,739,2020-04-27,4,your necks.”
740,13,105,740,2020-04-28,4,Underwood turned sharply. Some trouble of his own had stood between
741,4,104,741,2020-04-17,5,"him and the Rising news, but the Squire’s gibe had touched him now."
742,49,33,742,2020-04-07,5,"“The big hunt has been up many times, sir,” he said impatiently."
743,73,17,743,2020-04-14,4,“We’ve heard the Stuart shouting Tally-ho all down from Solway to the
744,23,137,744,2020-04-16,5,Thames--but we’ve never seen the fox. Oliphant is too sanguine always.”
745,2,205,745,2020-04-12,4,"Old Roger cut him short. “Oliphant, by grace o’ God, is like a bit of"
746,3,142,746,2020-04-20,4,Ferrara’s steel. I wish we had more like him. In my young days we did
747,33,194,747,2020-04-12,5,"not talk, and talk--we got to saddle when such as Oliphant of Muirhouse"
748,11,94,748,2020-04-12,4,"came to rouse us. You’re cold, I tell you, Will. Your voice rings"
749,8,91,749,2020-04-28,4,sleety.”
750,26,24,750,2020-04-18,5,Will Underwood glanced slowly from his host to Nance. He saw that she
751,39,195,751,2020-04-08,4,"was watching him, and caught fire from her silent, half-disdainful"
752,70,183,752,2020-04-16,5,question. Hot words--of loyalty and daring--ran out unbidden. And
753,19,27,753,2020-04-18,5,"Nance, in turn, warmed to his mood; for it was so she had watched him"
754,21,55,754,2020-04-20,4,"take his fences on hunting-days, so that he had half persuaded her to"
755,48,172,755,2020-05-05,4,love him outright and have done with it.
756,26,32,756,2020-05-02,5,But old Roger was still unconvinced. “We may be called out within the
757,52,77,757,2020-04-10,4,"month. Have you set your house in order, Will?”"
758,51,158,758,2020-04-11,5,Again the younger man seemed to be looking backward to some trouble
759,62,167,759,2020-04-12,5,"that had dwarfed his impulse. “Why, no, sir,” he answered lamely."
760,53,42,760,2020-04-28,4,“Surely I have had no time?”
761,70,46,761,2020-04-26,4,"“Just so,” put in the other dryly. “At my time of life, Will, men"
762,70,25,762,2020-04-14,5,learn to set things in order before the call comes. Best have all in
763,55,176,763,2020-04-13,5,readiness.”
764,15,88,764,2020-05-01,5,A troubled silence followed. They stood in the thick of peril soon to
765,69,105,765,2020-05-07,4,"come, and Squire Roger, haphazard and unthinking at usual times, had"
766,39,84,766,2020-04-26,4,"struck a note of faith that was deep, far sounding, not to be denied."
767,36,5,767,2020-04-23,5,"As if ashamed of his feeling, openly expressed, the Squire laughed"
768,29,55,768,2020-04-20,5,clumsily.
769,34,47,769,2020-05-11,4,"“I was boasting, Nance,” he said, putting a rough hand on her shoulder,"
770,2,188,770,2020-04-22,5,“and that’s more dangerous than hunting foxes--bagged foxes brought
771,70,21,771,2020-05-13,5,overseas from Hanover. Bless me! you were talking of staying here as
772,36,56,772,2020-04-28,5,"mistress, and I’ll not allow it. I’ve had a plan in my head since"
773,30,168,773,2020-05-03,4,Oliphant first brought the news.”
774,41,113,774,2020-05-14,5,"“But, father, I must stay here. Where else?”"
775,45,172,775,2020-05-01,4,"“At Windyhough. No, girl, I’ll have no arguments about it. You’ll be"
776,67,50,776,2020-05-10,4,protected there.”
777,49,19,777,2020-04-22,4,"Will Underwood laughed, and somehow Nance liked him none the better for"
778,15,109,778,2020-05-17,5,"it. “Sir Jasper will go with us, and Maurice, and every able-bodied man"
779,3,34,779,2020-05-15,5,about the place--who will be left to play guardian to Nance?”
780,12,155,780,2020-04-29,4,"“Rupert, unless I’ve misjudged the lad,” snapped the Squire."
781,2,14,781,2020-05-19,5,"“He cannot protect himself, sir.”"
782,51,45,782,2020-04-29,5,"“No. May be not--just yet. But I’ve faith in that lad, somehow. He’ll"
783,24,140,783,2020-05-22,5,look after other folk’s cattle better than his own. Some few are made
784,68,65,784,2020-04-28,4,"in that mould, Will. It’s a good mould, and rare.”"
785,1,150,785,2020-05-09,4,"His secret trouble, and his jealousy of any man who threatened to come"
786,73,104,786,2020-05-13,4,"close to Nance, swept Will Underwood’s prudence clean away. He should"
787,17,158,787,2020-05-11,4,"have known by now this bluff, uncompromising tone of the Squire’s."
788,22,132,788,2020-05-18,5,"“She’s safer here, sir,” he blundered on. “We all know Rupert for a"
789,50,44,789,2020-05-16,5,scholar--I’d rather trust Nance to her own women-servants.”
790,62,111,790,2020-05-15,5,"“But I would not,” put in old Roger dryly, “and I happen to have a"
791,32,101,791,2020-05-06,5,"say in the matter. If Rupert’s a fool--well, he shall have his chance"
792,27,120,792,2020-05-17,5,"of proving it. Nance, you go to Windyhough. That’s understood? The"
793,27,151,793,2020-05-05,5,"house down yonder can stand a siege, and this cannot. My fool of a"
794,3,119,794,2020-05-13,4,"grandfather--God rest him, all the same!--dismantled the house here."
795,42,166,795,2020-05-12,5,He thought there’d never again be civil war in Lancashire--but down at
796,20,193,796,2020-05-27,4,Windyhough they lived in hope.”
797,46,46,797,2020-05-08,4,Nance laughed--the brave laugh of a woman cradled in a house of gallant
798,12,64,798,2020-05-14,4,"faith, of loyalty to old tradition. She understood her father’s breezy,"
799,55,187,799,2020-05-29,4,"offhand talk of civil war, as if it were a pleasant matter. He would"
800,12,173,800,2020-05-19,5,"have chosen other means, she knew, if peace had shown the road; but"
801,24,190,801,2020-05-13,5,"better war, of friend against friend, than this corroding apathy that"
802,4,62,802,2020-05-20,4,had fallen on men’s ideals since the King-in-name ruled England by the
803,4,93,803,2020-05-27,4,help of foreign mercenaries.
804,55,16,804,2020-05-28,5,"Will Underwood caught infection from these two. The one was hale,"
805,25,61,805,2020-05-30,4,"bluff and hard-riding, a man proven; the other was a slip of a lassie,"
806,36,67,806,2020-06-05,4,slender as a reed and fanciful; yet each had the same eager outlook on
807,33,193,807,2020-06-06,5,"this matter of the Rising--an outlook that admitted no compromise, no"
808,70,186,808,2020-06-07,4,asking whether the time were ripe for sacrifice and peril. The moment
809,14,167,809,2020-05-17,4,"was instinct with drama to Underwood, and he was ready always to step"
810,70,129,810,2020-05-26,4,into the forefront of a scene.
811,15,69,811,2020-05-29,4,"“When are we needed, sir?” he asked, with a grave simplicity that was"
812,17,81,812,2020-05-24,4,equal to their own.
813,9,9,813,2020-06-03,4,"“Within the month, if all goes well with the march. There’s little"
814,53,172,814,2020-06-01,5,"time, Will, and much to do.”"
815,20,160,815,2020-05-30,5,"“Ay, there’s much to do--but we shall light a fire for every loyalist"
816,31,100,816,2020-05-28,4,"to warm his hands at. May the Prince come soon, say I.”"
817,58,123,817,2020-05-26,4,"The Squire glanced sharply at him. Will’s tone, his easy, gallant"
818,16,154,818,2020-06-14,4,"bearing, removed some doubts he had had of late touching the younger"
819,55,36,819,2020-05-25,5,"man’s fidelity; and when, a little later, Nance said that she would"
820,13,36,820,2020-05-30,5,"leave them to their wine, he permitted Will to open the door for her,"
821,59,198,821,2020-06-13,4,"to follow her for a moment into the draughty hall. He noticed, with an"
822,22,31,822,2020-06-01,5,"old man’s dry and charitable humour, that Nance dropped her kerchief"
823,26,139,823,2020-06-05,4,"as she went out, and that Will picked it up."
824,56,168,824,2020-06-11,4,"“The hunt is up,” he muttered. “The finest hunt is up that England"
825,47,80,825,2020-06-10,5,ever saw--and these two are playing a child’s game of drop-kerchief.
826,60,163,826,2020-06-09,4,"There’ll be time to make love by and by, surely, when peace comes in"
827,54,85,827,2020-06-09,5,again.”
828,64,88,828,2020-06-18,4,The Squire was restless. To his view of the Prince’s march from
829,4,75,829,2020-06-02,5,"Scotland, there was England’s happiness at stake. He would have to"
830,70,125,830,2020-06-10,5,"wait three weeks or so, drilling his men, rousing his neighbours to"
831,4,206,831,2020-06-20,4,"the rally, doing fifty things a day to keep his patience decently in"
832,11,79,832,2020-06-20,4,"bounds. He needed the gallop south, and the quick dangers of the road;"
833,31,129,833,2020-06-16,4,"and here, instead, were two youngsters who fancied love was all."
834,53,5,834,2020-06-08,4,Outside in the hall Nance and Will Underwood were facing each other
835,19,120,835,2020-06-09,5,with a certain grave disquiet. The wind was rising fast; its song
836,50,31,836,2020-06-22,3,overhead among the chimney-stacks was wild and comfortless; the draught
837,52,125,837,2020-06-08,5,"of it crept down the stairs, and under the main door, and through"
838,26,4,838,2020-06-05,4,"ill-fitting casements, blowing the candle-flames aslant and shaping"
839,24,195,839,2020-06-17,4,the droppings into what the country-folk called “candle-corpsies.”
840,26,143,840,2020-06-30,5,"Somewhere from the kitchen a maidservant was singing a doleful ballad,"
841,40,189,841,2020-06-16,4,"dear to rustic Lancashire, of one Sir Harry of Devilsbridge, who rode"
842,10,142,842,2020-06-24,5,out to his wedding one day and never was seen again save as a ghost
843,40,113,843,2020-06-19,4,that haunted Lang Rigg Moss.
844,21,138,844,2020-06-16,5,"“There’s a lively tune for Rising men to march to,” said Underwood, ill"
845,38,51,845,2020-06-23,4,"at ease somehow, yet forcing a gay laugh. “If I were superstitious----”"
846,46,136,846,2020-06-19,5,"“We are all superstitious,” broke in the other, restless as her father."
847,10,127,847,2020-06-29,5,"“Since babyhood we’ve listened to that note i’ the wind. Oh, it sobs,"
848,1,157,848,2020-06-08,4,"and will not any way be still! It comes homeless from the moors, and"
849,22,186,849,2020-06-22,4,cries to us to let it in. Martha is right to be singing yonder of souls
850,17,127,850,2020-06-26,4,crying over the Moss.”
851,73,179,851,2020-06-16,4,Again Will Underwood yielded to place and circumstance. He had watched
852,7,92,852,2020-07-07,5,"Nance grow up from lanky girlhood into a womanhood that, if it had no"
853,37,87,853,2020-07-08,5,"extravagance of beauty, arrested every man’s attention and made him"
854,37,52,854,2020-06-11,5,"better for the pause. He had hunted with her, in fair weather and in"
855,74,59,855,2020-06-23,4,"foul, had sat at meat with her in this house that kept open, hospitable"
856,62,160,856,2020-06-25,4,"doors. Yet, until to-night, he had not seen her as she was, a child of"
857,3,143,857,2020-06-19,4,"the moors, passionate, wayward, strong for the realities of human pity,"
858,32,60,858,2020-07-11,5,human need for faith and constancy.
859,41,166,859,2020-06-27,4,"“I have your kerchief, Nance,” he said. The gravity, the quietness of"
860,67,77,860,2020-06-18,5,"his tone surprised her. “I’ll keep it, by your leave.”"
861,68,146,861,2020-07-12,5,"She glanced at him, and there was trouble in her eyes. This news of"
862,53,96,862,2020-07-04,5,"the Rising had stirred every half-forgotten longing, inbred in her,"
863,3,33,863,2020-07-11,4,"that a Stuart might reign again, gallant and debonair and kingly, over"
864,9,37,864,2020-06-20,4,"this big-little land of England. She wished the old days back, with"
865,14,15,865,2020-07-04,5,"desperate eagerness--the days when men were not blameless, as in a"
866,66,8,866,2020-06-21,4,"fairy-tale, but when, at any rate, they served their King for loyalty"
867,56,180,867,2020-07-09,4,"instead of prudence. Yet, now, with Will Underwood here, her hopes of"
868,27,90,868,2020-07-05,4,the Rising grew shadowy and far-away. She was not thinking of England
869,21,21,869,2020-07-02,4,"or the Stuart; she was asking herself, with piteous appeal for help,"
870,68,11,870,2020-07-13,5,"whether her own little life was to be marred or made by this big,"
871,51,193,871,2020-07-04,5,loose-built man whom all women were supposed to love at sight. She drew
872,17,20,872,2020-07-04,4,"her skirts away from such intemperate, unstable love; but she had known"
873,3,110,873,2020-06-22,5,"Will Underwood long, had dreamed of him o’ nights, had shaped him to"
874,57,72,874,2020-07-10,5,some decent likeness of a hero.
875,43,179,875,2020-06-26,5,"“No, you’ll not keep it. You will give it back to me. Oh, I insist!”"
876,9,49,876,2020-07-20,5,"she broke off, again with her father’s quick, heedless need to be"
877,16,13,877,2020-07-06,4,obeyed.
878,25,93,878,2020-06-25,4,He put the kerchief into her hand. “So you’re sending me a beggar to
879,5,182,879,2020-07-21,4,"the wars,” he said sullenly."
880,57,168,880,2020-07-02,4,"“If you go to the wars”--she was looking wistfully at him, as if asking"
881,67,144,881,2020-07-24,4,for some better answer to her need of faith--“you shall take it with
882,19,130,882,2020-07-12,5,"you, Mr. Underwood.”"
883,55,160,883,2020-06-29,4,"“You doubt me, Nance?”"
884,34,183,884,2020-07-03,4,"“Doubt? I doubt everything these days: you, and the Prince’s march"
885,51,115,885,2020-07-20,5,"from Scotland, and all--why, all I’m too tired to hope for. You do not"
886,51,122,886,2020-07-19,5,"guess how tired I am. To-morrow, may be, the wind will be quieter--and"
887,58,90,887,2020-07-19,4,Martha will not be singing from the kitchens how Sir Harry rode over
888,59,153,888,2020-07-12,5,"Devilsbridge and came back, without his body, to haunt the moors."
889,49,195,889,2020-07-31,2,"Good-night, Mr. Underwood. Go talk with father of the Rising.”"
890,40,200,890,2020-07-29,4,Yet still they lingered for a moment. Through all her
891,57,5,891,2020-07-20,5,weariness--through the vague distrust that was chilling her--she
892,61,15,892,2020-07-30,4,"remembered the day-time intimacy, the nights of long, girlish dreams,"
893,29,127,893,2020-07-14,5,that had gone to the making of her regard for Will. It was untrue--it
894,22,46,894,2020-07-13,4,must be untrue--that he was half-hearted in this enterprise that was to
895,47,80,895,2020-07-16,4,set England free of the intolerable yoke. If Will’s honour went by the
896,22,44,896,2020-07-18,4,"board, she would begin to doubt her own good faith."
897,2,16,897,2020-08-04,4,"What was passing in Will Underwood’s mind he himself scarcely knew,"
898,9,110,898,2020-08-07,5,"perhaps. He was full of trouble, indecision; but he glanced at Nance,"
899,50,202,899,2020-08-02,5,"saw the frank question and appeal in her face, and his doubts slipped"
900,49,104,900,2020-07-25,5,by him.
901,71,4,901,2020-07-29,5,"“I shall claim that kerchief, Nance,” he said--“before the month is"
902,25,206,902,2020-07-17,5,"out, if Oliphant brought a true message south.”"
903,27,18,903,2020-07-26,5,Nance glanced at him. “Mr. Oliphant never lies. His enemies admit as
904,44,170,904,2020-07-22,4,much. So come for what I’ll give--if you come before the month is out.”
905,14,83,905,2020-07-23,5,"She was gone before he could insist on one last word, and Will"
906,18,163,906,2020-08-10,5,"Underwood turned impatiently to seek his host. A half-hour later, after"
907,50,117,907,2020-07-29,5,"she had heard him get to saddle and ride away, Nance came downstairs,"
908,31,187,908,2020-08-15,5,and found her father pacing up and down the dining-chamber.
909,31,182,909,2020-07-31,5,"“What, you?” growled old Roger. “I thought you were in bed by this"
910,47,8,910,2020-08-03,4,"time, child.”"
911,37,97,911,2020-08-13,4,"“I cannot sleep.” She came to his side, and put a friendly arm through"
912,44,49,912,2020-08-07,5,"his. “Father, am I right? It seems there are so many--so many of our"
913,19,123,913,2020-08-16,5,men who are cold----”
914,25,137,914,2020-08-17,4,"“Why, damme, that’s just what I was thinking,” roared the Squire, his"
915,57,122,915,2020-08-16,4,good-humour returning when another shared his loneliness. “It’s the
916,39,49,916,2020-07-31,5,older men who are warm--the older men who are going to carry this
917,5,46,917,2020-08-11,4,business through. It was not so in my young days. Our fathers licked
918,41,189,918,2020-07-25,4,"us into better shape, and we’d fewer luxuries, may be. Why, child, we"
919,72,128,919,2020-08-20,5,"dared not play fast and loose with loyalty, as some of these young"
920,72,175,920,2020-08-21,4,blades are doing.”
921,7,45,921,2020-08-15,4,"“They ask for reasons, father. Young Hunter of Hunterscliff rode up"
922,47,58,922,2020-08-02,5,"to me to-day, as we were waiting for hounds to strike the scent. And"
923,26,205,923,2020-08-10,5,"I spoke of the Rising, because I can think of little else these days;"
924,63,6,924,2020-08-17,5,"and he yawned, in the lackadaisical way he brought from London a year"
925,40,32,925,2020-08-16,5,"ago, and said the Prince was following a wild-goose chase. And he, too,"
926,53,6,926,2020-08-08,5,asked for reasons--asked why he should give up a hunting life for the
927,2,60,927,2020-08-04,5,pleasure of putting his neck into a halter.”
928,50,87,928,2020-08-08,3,"Roger Demaine stood, square and big, with his back to the fire. His"
929,11,156,929,2020-08-01,4,"fine apparel, the ordered comfort of the room, could not disguise his"
930,34,203,930,2020-08-15,4,"ruggedness. He was an out-of-doors man, simple, passionate, clean as"
931,10,17,931,2020-08-16,5,the winds and an open life could make him. “Hunter of Hunterscliff will
932,72,147,932,2020-08-05,5,put his neck into a worse halter if he airs such shallow stuff. I’d
933,8,183,933,2020-08-01,5,have had him ducked in the nearest horse-pond if he’d said that to me.”
934,59,5,934,2020-08-22,5,"The two looked quietly at each other, father and daughter, each knowing"
935,47,126,935,2020-08-28,5,that there was need of some deeper confidence.
936,27,172,936,2020-08-04,5,"“You dropped your kerchief just now, Nance,” said Roger dryly, “and"
937,38,99,937,2020-08-13,4,Will Underwood picked it up. Did he keep it?”
938,60,133,938,2020-08-02,4,"The girl was full of trouble. Her father’s happiness, the welfare"
939,3,146,939,2020-08-07,5,"of the English land which she loved almost to idolatry, her trust"
940,2,106,940,2020-08-27,5,"in Underwood’s honour, were all at stake. But she stood proud and"
941,74,158,941,2020-08-23,5,self-reliant. “Did you train me to drop my kerchief for any man to
942,29,133,942,2020-08-07,4,"keep? I tell you, sir--as I told Mr. Underwood just now--that he may"
943,19,145,943,2020-08-09,5,claim it when--when he has proved himself.”
944,58,94,944,2020-08-07,5,The Squire was in complete good-humour now. This girl of his was as a
945,31,128,945,2020-08-16,5,"woman should be, suave and bendable as a hazel-twig, yet strong, not"
946,27,131,946,2020-08-31,4,"to be broken by any onset of the wind. He could afford to tease her,"
947,65,123,947,2020-08-18,4,now that his mind was easy.
948,20,69,948,2020-08-17,5,"“Why, surely Will has proved himself,” he said, smiling down at her"
949,46,56,949,2020-08-21,4,from his big height. “He can take his fences with any man. He can take
950,4,10,950,2020-08-12,5,"his liquor, too, when need asks, and watch weaker men slide gently"
951,71,50,951,2020-08-16,5,"under-table. He can hit four birds out of five, Nance, and is a proper"
952,70,153,952,2020-08-22,5,lady’s man as well. Dear heart! what more does the child ask from a
953,49,117,953,2020-08-11,5,lover?”
954,52,170,954,2020-09-05,5,"“I ask so little of him--just to ride out, and ride in again after the"
955,65,120,955,2020-09-02,4,bells are ringing a Stuart home. To risk a little hardship. To come
956,25,110,956,2020-08-18,5,"out of his hunting and his pretty parlour ways, and face the open."
957,72,90,957,2020-08-13,4,"What else does any woman claim from any man, when--oh, when the need"
958,45,168,958,2020-08-30,5,"is urgent? Father, it was you who taught me what this Rising means--it"
959,2,206,959,2020-08-20,4,"is Faith, and decency, and happiness for England, fighting against a"
960,56,43,960,2020-09-02,5,"rabble brought overseas from Germany, because they cannot trust the"
961,55,13,961,2020-08-26,4,"English army. It is--the breath of our English gardens that’s at stake,"
962,52,102,962,2020-08-24,4,and yet such as this Hunterscliff lad can yawn about it.”
963,40,71,963,2020-08-21,4,"“Will Underwood yawns, you mean,” snapped the Squire. “It was Underwood"
964,7,127,964,2020-08-19,4,"you were thinking of. I share your doubts, Nance. He is this and"
965,22,34,965,2020-09-10,5,"that, and a few men speaking well of him--but there’s a flaw in him"
966,39,151,966,2020-08-29,5,"somewhere. I never could set a finger on it, but the flaw is there.”"
967,44,165,967,2020-08-24,5,"She turned on him, with hot inconsequence. “He is not proved as yet."
968,46,147,968,2020-08-29,4,"I said no more than that. You never liked him, father. You--you are"
969,66,157,969,2020-08-28,5,unjust.”
970,30,30,970,2020-09-02,5,"“Well, no; I never liked him. But I’m content to wait. If I’ve"

972,34,50,972,2020-09-05,4,"child, this liking for Wild Will?” he broke off, with rough, anxious"
973,15,105,973,2020-08-26,5,tenderness. “I’m clumsy with women--I always was--and you’ve no mother
974,10,85,974,2020-09-08,1,"to go to in search of a good, healthy cry.”"
975,71,153,975,2020-09-12,4,"“Why should it go deep?” she asked, with a pride that would not yield"
